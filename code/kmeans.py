"""
This script implements kmeans clustering to obtain the anchor boxes for YOLO.
The bounding boxes are currently given by tuples of the form (x0, y0,x1, y1), where (x0,y0) 
are the coordinates of the lower left corner and the x1, y1 are the coordinates of the upper right corner.

We need to extract the width and height from these coordinates, 
and normalize data with respect to image width and height.

However, after preprocessing, we will always have the same image size for all images; 416 * 416.
